    <p>BEM stands for Block, Element, Modifier, and it is a naming convention used in web development to create
        consistent and maintainable CSS classes. Here's a example

        Block: It represents a standalone component or module on a webpage. Blocks are named in lowercase and
        hyphen-separated words, like .main or .menu.

        Element: Elements are parts of a block and are denoted by two underscores (__).They are also named in lowercase,
        like (.main__para1)

        Modifier: Modifiers are used to alter the appearance or behavior of a block or element. They are denoted by two
        hyphens (--) and are added to the block or element the modify, like (.main__para--p1.)
